        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
        
        <p>I would see scenes like beutiful fields of dandelions</p>
        
        <p>And animals like  raccoons, badgers and frogs</p>
        
        <p>And eat food like pancakes and earl grey tea</p>
        
        <p> I would be there with my best friend Claudia in Brittany</p>
        
        <p> And paint totebags on a red and white checkered picnic blanket</p>
